A simple project using Tensorflow to identify if an image contains a dog or a cats. Using a Keras Sequential model, I was able to identify with about 90% accuracy whether a photo contained a dog or a cat. This notebook is for learning purposes only and the project is based on the Kaggle competition Dogs vs. Cats. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
